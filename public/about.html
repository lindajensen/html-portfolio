<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Tech-loving teacher that's looking to trade in her whiteboard for a keyboard. My job for the last 10+ years has been to educate society's future badasses. Even though teaching has been a passion of mine for a long time, lately I've found myself becoming more and more interested in the world of coding and web development.</p>

<p>I'm new to front-end development and my goal is to learn as much as I can during this next year. With dedication and hard work, I hope to build a strong foundation that will allow me to transition into web development. I love learning new things; when I'm passionate about something I immerse myself completely in it. I've been told that I'm quite creative, which I think shows in the assignments I create for my students.</p> 

<p>Even though working as a teacher has been incredibly rewarding and something I've loved doing, I feel that it's time to move on and embrace new opportunities and challenges. Don't be afraid to reach out if you want to be part of my journey into web development, or if you're interested in getting to know more about me.</p>
